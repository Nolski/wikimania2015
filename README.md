# Description
It's been a long time since the WMF planned on launching a large initiative into online video way back in 2009. Since then, the power of video on not only the web, but also mobile has grown an incredible amount.

Mozilla's Popcorn Maker project leverages popcorn.js users to remix popular videos on the web and share them. As a cloud services developer at Mozilla I have worked with the Web Maker team to port this editor into it's own javascript module and create a python library for transcoding popcorn videos into flat video files. I along with other Mozillians and Wikimedians at WMF have been working on building a plan of integrating this into the wikimedia software suite and build a road map of what sort of features we'd like to see in the future.

In this talk I plan to:
  - Demo what work I have completed so far.
  - Go over the road map of what features we would like to see.
  - Begin a discussion of how video fits into wikis and how what is built so far can help make that happen.
