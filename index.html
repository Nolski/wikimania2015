          <img src="/img/airmo.png" alt=""/>
        <aside class="notes">I work on a product called Air Mozilla which is a video streaming site akin to youtube 
        but most recently I have been working on creating an in browser solution for editing uploaded videos </aside>

        <section>
          <img src="/img/popcorn.png" alt=""/>
          <aside class="notes">Most of my work has stemmed from Popcorn Maker, a project built by the Mozilla Foundation Webmaker team.
          During my time on this project I've created a fork which contains strictly the front end components for the
          editor and allows users to hook up javascript events for loading and saving content through the editor. </aside>

				<section>
          <img src="/img/wmf.png" style="height: 600px" alt=""/>
          <aside class="notes">I was then approached by Ben Moskowitz from Mozilla Foundation and introduced to SJ Klein at WMF
            They introduced me to a lot of the great video initiatives going on within the wikimedia communities </aside>

				<section>
          <img src="/img/wikimania.png" style="height: 600px" alt=""/>
          <aside class="notes"> So now I'm here, at Wikimania, with all of you, doing this talk. Pitching this editor and video
          content and how it can change how we think of Open Knowledge.
           So before I go on about the tech I have built I want to try and show how important video has been in the
           evolution of the web and how we consume information.  </aside>

          <h3>200 petabytes of <a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post/official-year-end-self-appraisal-and-profound-intr">video played on Vimeo</a> in 2012</h3>
          <aside class="notes"> as I'm sure you've all heard video on the web has been increasing an incredible amount. In 2012 Vimeo
            reported that users played over 200 petabytes of video.</aside>

        <section>
          <img src="/img/cat.jpg" alt="" style="boarder: none"/>
          <aside class="notes"> Videos on the internet are no longer simply cat videos and people being kicked in the testicles either.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src="/img/youtube_news.png" alt="" style="boarder: none"/>
          <aside class="notes"> The web is full of great things. Things that help you learn and share knowledge. 7000 hours of video are
          uploaded to youtube daily. Videos uploaded that were tagged Obama or Romney were viewed 2.7 BILLION times during
          the 2012 election cycle. That's 3x the views of Gangnam style </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
            <img src="/img/edu.png" alt="" style="boarder: none"/>
          <aside class="notes">As a student I probably spend the same amount of time consuming free educational video content as I do
            listening to a professor re-iterate the same things for tens of thousands of dollars per year. </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src="/img/editor.png" alt="" style="boarder: none"/>
          <aside class="notes">So that's my case for why video is important for wikimedia and such. So I've been working on this video
          video editor to allow users of air mozilla to modify and remix uploaded content. What does it look like? well,
          it looks something like this. The front end of the editor is this modular javascript library that you can
          just bower install and then we are implementing a back end message queue powered by ffmpeg that converts the
          editors output (popcorn.js json) into a flat rendered video file.</aside>

          <h3>The Transcoder</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/nolski/popcoder">https://github.com/nolski/popcoder</a>
        <aside class="notes">So of course both of these projects are open source and I am currently hosting the upstream on github under
          my name. It may however later change to be under mozilla.</aside>

            <li>create a modular video editor easily embeddable through a simple javascript API. (and fix all the <a href="https:github.com/nolski/popcorn-editor/issues/">outstanding bugs</a>)</li>
            <li>Create a method of transcoding popcorn videos into flat video files for portability</li>
            <li>Make these tools known to everyone who would like to use them and assist in integration.</li>
